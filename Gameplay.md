### Gameplay

Societypoly offers a rich and immersive gaming experience where players can explore the complexities of economic systems, politics, and societal dynamics. Below, we detail the key gameplay components and mechanics:

#### Game Components:

-   **Two Boards:**
    
    -   Player Board: A 52-tile board representing the 52 weeks in a year, allowing for season/year dynamics.
    -   Entity Board: Tracks the progress of three different entities - Corporate Empires, Nature, and the State.
-   **Player Tokens:** Each player uses unique and distinguishable tokens to mark their progress on the board.
    
-   **Money:** Societypoly includes a currency system with denominations and designed banknotes, allowing players to manage their finances.
    
-   **Global Events Cards:** These cards introduce varying events with both positive and negative consequences, adding unpredictability to the game.
    
-   **Improvement Cards:** Improvement cards replace the traditional street cards in Monopoly. When a player lands on a free tile for the first time, they pick a path (Nature, Corporate, or State) from a card pile. This improvement is then attached to the tile, following the rules on the cards and affecting players and the entity cursors.
    

#### Objectives:

-   **Missions:** Each player receives a mission at the start, influenced by societal social classes. These classes include age (old-young), wealth (rich-poor), location (rural-city), scope (local-global), political/economic alignment (liberal-conservative, communist-capitalist), and more. These missions add depth and strategic variety to the game.
    
-   **Endings:** Societypoly offers multiple potential end structures:
    
    -   Players could play for a fixed number of "years."
    -   The game ends when a specific event occurs.
    -   A player reaches a predetermined milestone.

#### Board Tiles:

Societypoly features a diverse set of board tiles, each with unique characteristics and effects:

-   **World Wonders:** These tiles replace infrastructures and offer unique bonuses when developed in alignment with a specific entity.
    
-   **New Year:** A crucial tile that marks the start of the game loop. During this phase, players handle taxes and select resolutions that can impact the game's direction.
    
-   **Rehabilitation Center/Visiting:** This tile replaces the visiting/jail tile and serves as a place for reflection and personal growth.
    
-   **Burnout:** A phase of rest that replaces the "go to jail" tile. Players go to the Rehabilitation Center during this phase.
    
-   **World Expo:** Replacing the free parking tile, players select from three global events, each offering its own set of bonuses and challenges.
    
-   **Global Networks:** These tiles replace the train stations and represent avenues for information, transport, finance, and culture. Each type provides specific game advantages.
    
-   **Taxes:** Societypoly replaces the income & luxury tax tiles with sustainability levy, shareholder payment, and citizen duty tiles, each with its own calculation method and impact on players.
    
-   **World Events:** These tiles replace the chance tiles and introduce global challenges or opportunities that influence gameplay.
    
-   **Philanthropy Cards:** Replacing the community chest tiles, these cards offer rewards or challenges based on societal contributions.
    
-   **Optional Tiles:** Societypoly may include optional tiles for events like the Summer/Winter Olympics or religious celebrations. These tiles could provide unique gameplay experiences.
    

#### Entity Mechanics:

Entities in Societypoly are represented by Corporate Empires, the State, and Nature. These entities behave like RPG characters, starting with a cursor at a specific level and moving up or down through the game via cards, events, and other mechanics. Players can influence these entities' progress, and their actions have a direct impact on the game world.

#### Game Dynamics:

-   **Yearly Cycle:** Societypoly operates on a yearly cycle, with the board's 52 tiles representing seasons and years. This cycle introduces seasonal changes that can influence various game mechanics, such as taxes, world events, or tile values.
    
-   **Variable Endings:** The game offers multiple potential endings, allowing players to adapt their strategies based on the chosen game's ending structure. This variability ensures that each game is potentially unique.
    
-   **Players' Missions:** The missions assigned to players encourage strategic gameplay without bias. The objectives should be subtle and not include directives like "destroy nature" to maintain gameplay flexibility.
    
-   **Improved Tiles Can Be Destroyed:** Players have the opportunity to destroy improved tiles through events like wars, disasters, hostile takeovers, and more. This introduces a dynamic element to the game and keeps players engaged.
